## 7-Sentence Narrative

I looked at a dataset of 64,000 video games to find out which types of games sell the most. Action and Shooter games make the most money—together they make up 32% of all sales. The best-selling games are mostly GTA and Call of Duty, which are all action or shooter games. PlayStation is the biggest gaming platform, with 51% of the market. Most game sales come from North America, which makes up 51% of buyers worldwide. Building a game series pays off—Call of Duty earned $303 million across multiple titles. So the winning formula is simple: make an action or shooter game, release it on PlayStation, and target North American players.
